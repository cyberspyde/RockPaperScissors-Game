# RockPaperScissors-Game
This is my second project which was created in September 2019 using HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT. 

I have used the simple random function in Javascript to make computer decide. This game is completely random.

I made this algorithm first in C language and then implemented that code into WEB in order to bring some design to my project.
